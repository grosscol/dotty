# Convenience Recreating Dev Machine Setup

Currently built on ubuntu bionic this includes bash rc, system settings, and package selections.

## Bashrc
The current addendum to stock ~/.bashrc provided by ubuntu.

## pieces.md
Much the same content as the bashrc addendum, but split out and has some comment and explanation.

## packages-ubuntu
Repo and package selections for current system.  
Serves as a refernce for:

- "where the heck was I pulling that package from?" 
- "What was the name of that package I was using for this thing?"

## Rprofile
From `~/.Rprofile` that automatically loads devtools for interactive sessions
